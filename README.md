## My process

### Built with

- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - SASS Preprocessor

### What I learned

This is my first project using SASS, I tried to make a "pixel perfect" replica in all devices. It was a hard challenge but I'm happy with the overall page.

### Continued development

It migh be a better way to organize the layout and do the responsive, also I will find a better way to manage the responsiveness of central div in the footer section.
